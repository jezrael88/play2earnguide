195 - That's the total hype points (HP) needed to get this season reward - the Toaster Backpack. As you know, season 00 already ended and with that, there were only **389 players** who were able to get the **Sgt Poppy Blanko**.

That's not a lot. 

We've seen new Blankos here and there with 3000 supply, 500 limited supply etc. But 389 is a very low number.

Which means, sometime in the future, it could demand a high price due to its limited availability. As of this writing, the SGT Poppy available is at $800!

For those players who missed the Sgt Poppy worry no more because this is now the opportunity to secure an **NFT for FREE**. We'll not actually free since we're all spending time playing this game anyway. 

So, 195. That's a smaller number compared to the previous season's reward. But that's because this new season will only last until Aug. 24th. That's approximately 3 weeks to secure that coveted season reward.

How fast can you possibly get the reward? Will there be enough time to secure it even if you can only spend a few hours for this game? 

Absolutely!

I have written this piece to help new players and even the older ones on how to maximize your time and strategize to secure that coveted season reward. 

## Hype Points Breakdown per challenge Type

So now back to the drawing board. We need 195 to secure the toaster backpack. As I have calculated, the **season challenge** itself will give us 138 max hype points.

The **weekly challenge** will potentially give 21 per week. Max of 63 for the whole season. 

Lastly, there's a potential of 3 hype points per day for the **daily challenge**. That's 63 max HP for 21 days.

That means you can potentially secure 42 HP on your first 7 days. 84 total for 14 days.

I have intentionally not included the season reward HP calculation since majority of them can be achieved by playing the daily and weekly challenge. 

I myself already racked up 77 HP in a span of 4 days. That's only 1-2 hours of playing.

Hypothetically, you can win the toaster backpack in less than 2 week as long as you complete the daily challenge. And by also knocking out the weekly and season challenge at the same time.

Right below are the my top **4 tips how to secure Toaster Backpack in Blankos** in a limited amount of time.

## Tip # 1: Knock-out the easy ones

Ask yourself, what type of game are you strong at? Are you more fond of vibe collection like me? Are you the shooter type? Knock out those easy ones first to boost your confidence.

Also, what aspect of the game do you enjoy the most. You may want to start with those first. Once you identify your strengths or part of the game you enjoy, follow tip 2.

## Tip # 2: Hit 2 or more birds in one stone

At the early course of the season, there's an abundance of opportunity to knockout multiple challenges in one go. 

Find 2 or more quests that you can do in one game, or maybe in the junction.

Myself, I love running around the junction. Getting those vibes also made it more enjoyable. It compels me to go to the other areas of the junction. 

In this example I found these 3 quests that I can do in the junction.

As you know, there's a lot of vibes in the junction. And there's a few slides too. 

If you happen to select a quest that requires waiting do tip # 3.

## Tip # 3: Perform your skills challenge pre-game

One of my early complaints about the game is the waiting time for block parties. Sometime, I just can't wait for other players to join in.

Fortunately, I have discovered that you can accomplish some challenges while in the waiting area.

While you're waiting for other players to join, executing some challenges will actually count.

In these screenshot, I was able to "Perform 10 skills in shooters" while still waiting for the game to start.

I was able to complete my 50 skills while waiting for the other players in the vibe collection game too.

## Tip #4: Play with your friends

I remember reading a book or an article a long time ago saying that if you enjoy something, you'll enjoy it even more with friends. 

Whatever it is, whether it is a game, activity or what, we'll enjoy it even more with friends. No wonder, no man is an island.

Also, if you're having a hard time with some quests, your friends can help too. Just make sure you don't let anyone else join to not spoil your plans (lol). 

## Bonus tip: Have fun!

If you find yourself stuck in a quest? Take a break and so something fun. It could be listening to a music. Playing another game, or just running around the junction.

At the end of the day, we all just want to have fun. 

I hope you all learned from this short blog. If you have anything to add, don't hesitate to reach me out. 

Best of luck to everyone!
